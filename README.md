FΛVI AIR v1.0.0 — Initial Release
This marks the official launch of FΛVI AIR, an autonomous aerial platform designed for GPS-denied indoor environments. This release establishes the core architecture for Physical AI-driven flight and real-time industrial telemetry.

FΛVI AIR is the primary aerial node of the FΛVI network, bridging the gap between digital intelligence and physical autonomy.
