FΛVI AIR v1.0.0 — Initial Release
FΛVI AIR is the primary aerial node of the FΛVI network, bridging the gap between digital intelligence and physical autonomy.

This marks the official launch of FΛVI AIR, an autonomous aerial platform designed for GPS-denied indoor environments. This release establishes the core architecture for Physical AI-driven flight and real-time industrial telemetry.

Key Features
FΛVI CORE Logic: Initial implementation of the "Agentic Brain" for state management (Idle, Patrol, Emergency).

Physical AI Navigation: Modular framework for SLAM 4.0 and 360° LiDAR sensor fusion.

Cyan-Carbon Dashboard: A high-fidelity React interface for real-time telemetry via WebSockets.

Stealth Mode: Integrated logic for ultra-silent operation (<45dB target) in sensitive environments.

Technical Architecture
OS: ROS 2 Jazzy Jalisco (Ubuntu 24.04) support.

Communication: Secure WebSocket bridge between the on-board Physical AI and the Command Center.

Safety: Hard-coded "Kill-Switch" protocols and local-first data encryption for industrial security.
