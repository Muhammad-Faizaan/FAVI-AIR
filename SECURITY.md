# 🛡️ FΛVI Security Manifesto (v1.0)

> "Intelligence is nothing without Integrity."

**FΛVI** is an autonomous ecosystem designed for high-stakes industrial environments. We recognize that in the age of Physical AI, security is the foundation of safety. This document outlines our commitment to protecting the data, hardware, and operational sovereignty of the FΛVI network.

## 🔐 The FΛVI Secure-Core Architecture

1. **Sovereign Edge Logic:** Data captured by FΛVI agents (such as FΛVI AIR) is processed locally. We do not rely on external clouds for real-time decision-making, eliminating the largest attack surface in modern robotics.
2. **The Λ-Handshake:** Every connection within the FΛVI ecosystem requires a dual-key cryptographic handshake. If the signature doesn't match, the agent enters an immediate "Vault" state.
3. **Encrypted Telemetry:** All dashboard-to-agent communication is wrapped in end-to-end encryption, preventing unauthorized interception or "command injection" attacks.
4. **Physical AI Kill-Switch:** A hardware-level override exists on every FΛVI agent to ensure human control remains the ultimate authority.

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

We provide active security monitoring for the following ecosystem layers:

| Layer | Status |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FΛVI CORE v1.0** | ✅ Active |
| **FΛVI AIR v1.0** | ✅ Active |

## 🪲 Vulnerability Disclosure

If you identify a security risk within the FΛVI ecosystem:
1. **Report Privately:** Use the GitHub "Security" tab to report vulnerabilities.
2. **Response Time:** Our security team will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
3. **Bounty Program:** Significant findings that improve FΛVI ecosystem integrity are eligible for recognition in our "Engineered Intelligence" Hall of Fame.
